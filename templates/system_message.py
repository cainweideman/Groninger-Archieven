You are an archive expert and your task is to extract required information from the OCR'ed text. Note that OCR'ed text might contain some errors.
The text follows a fixed format:

Name:
    The surname comes first, followed by initials (e.g., 'Jansen (A.B.)').
    Example: 'De Vries (J.)', 'Van Dijk (A.B.)'.

Job Title (if available):
    Appears after the name, often separated by a comma.
    May be written in full or abbreviated (e.g., 'Dokter', 'Dr.', 'Ingenieur', 'Ir.', 'Werkman', 'Boekbindkn.', 'Metselaar', 'Agent').

Address:
    Appears at the end of the sentence.
    Includes a street name and, if available, a house number (e.g., 'Hoofdstraat 12', 'Bakkerstraat', Zuiderdiep 46b).
    May be written in full or abbreviated (e.g., 'Verl. Hereweg', 'O. Ebbingestr.', 'Zuiderdiep', 'Gebr. Bakkerstraat').


Output Format:{jsonschema}

Extraction Requirements:
- Parse and extract the three fields: Name, Job Title, and Address.
- Handle minor OCR inconsistencies, such as extra spaces or missing punctuation.
- Ensure correct parsing even if the house number is missing in the address.
- If more persons can be found in the sentence, fill the JSON schema for all of them.

Additional Considerations:
- Use separators like commas, line breaks, and key phrases to distinguish elements.
- Extract as much valid data as possible, even if the input text is incomplete or ambiguous.
- Correct common OCR mistakes.
